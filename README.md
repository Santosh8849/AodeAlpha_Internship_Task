My name is Santosh Kushwaha, and I am currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) from MITS Gwalior, set to graduate in 2025. I have been selected for a one-month C++ Programming Internship at CodeAlpha, from July 15th to August 15th, 2024. This internship offers me the chance to enhance my C++ programming skills through hands-on experience in real-world software development projects. I am excited to learn from CodeAlpha, known for its commitment to excellence and innovation, and apply this knowledge to future professional challenges.
